I'm a highschool kid who's grades suffer because i build circuits and write code instead of doing homework

Most of my projects here started cause i needed something to work on instead of school.

The most recent ones are projects ive had on my desktop and never published or finished, so i took some time to do both. (again, in neglect of school ðŸ˜‰:)

```json
{
    "peter": {
        "hobbies": [
            "Programming",
            "hacking around with Arduino",
            "going to the skatepark",
            "doing flips outside",
            "circuit bending",
        ]

        "languages": {
            "main": [
                "JavaScript",
                "PHP",
                "Python",
                "Arduino (C/C++)",
            ],

            "working on": [
                "Java",
                "Go",
            ]
